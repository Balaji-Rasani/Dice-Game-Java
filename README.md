🎲 Dice Game in Java
---
A simple command-line Dice Game built in Java where the player rolls a dice until they roll a 1. 
The game ends when the player rolls a 1, and the final score is displayed.
---

📜 Game Rules
---
The game prompts the player to enter 10 to roll the dice.

If the player enters anything other than 10, they are prompted again.

A random number between 1 and 6 is generated to simulate the dice roll.

If the player rolls a 1, the game ends and displays the final score.

Any number other than 1 adds to the player's total score.

✅ The dice roll generates numbers between 1 to 6 (inclusive), simulating a real six-faced die.
